Amazon Order History
    - Nicer item replace, where we keep the UI as much as possible, and only insert new UI

    - Infinite scroll, loading more once we near the bottom
        - But at the start, always load 7 pages, so we can find all undelivered

    - Replace time dropdown and show our own order count, based on what we're showing
        - `132 orders since 2022 January 1`

    - Show active state via the extension icon
    - Support toggling on/off
        - Via injected switch + clicking the extension

    - Switch to show undelivered + within the last 24 hours in reverse order (which can be useful to know if any packages are ready)

    - Icons for different views
        - list
        - grid
        - grid tiny (hide some buttons and shrink the box max-width, so we can see a lot of items at once)

    - Remove "ship to" text, because it's broken anyways

    - Multi-language support
        - Multi-language date parsing
        - language specific text in UI

Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(".yohtmlc-order-id")).forEach(x => x.innerHTML = "123-4567890-1234567");
document.querySelector("#nav-link-accountList-nav-line-1").innerHTML = "Hello, Sliftist";
